<h1> OCR </h1>
<p>OCR -Optical Character Recognition or optical character reader
is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed,
handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text,
whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo
or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.'''
<ul>
<li> The first step of ocr is using a scanner to process the physical form of
  a document </li>

<li>Once all pages are copied , OCR software converts the document into a
  two- color, or black and white version </li>


<li> The scanned -in image or bitmap is analysed for light and dark areas ,
where dark areas are identified as characters that need to be recognised
  and light areas are identified as background </li>
  </ul>
